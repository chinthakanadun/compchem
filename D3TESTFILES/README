## Usage ##
python eval_D3.py s6 rs6 s8 filename.com/.out 

s6, rs6 and s8 are variable parameters that Grimme has published for the various functionals

If the file is g09 output, the script will try and use the appropriate parameters, but so far I have only coded for B3LYP and the Minnesota functionals

The results (given in Hartree) should be the same as dftd3 with zero-damping (i.e. not BJ-damped) and with the 3-body term switched on (-abc in the original)

(3-body term can be switched off near the bottom of eval_D3.py)


## Examples ##

1. Specifying B3LYP params for an input file
rpaton$ python eval_D3.py 1.0 1.261 1.703 CH3F.com

s6 = 1.0 rs6 =  1.261 s8 = 1.703
   Breakdown   Attractive-R6   Attractive-R8   Repulsive-3-Body   Total   (Hartree)
   CH3F.com -1.92973198055e-05 -0.000722345327786 2.55309958043e-07 -0.000741387337633


2. B3LYP outfile - params don't matter as the script will figure it out (hopefully) - only works with a few functionals
rpaton$ python eval_D3.py 1 1 1 CH3F2TS.log
